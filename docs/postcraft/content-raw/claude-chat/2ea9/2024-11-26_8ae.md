 Let me break down the key differences between these three options:

Hydrogen:
- Local development environment
- Works directly with your local Node.js installation and files
- Real-time code execution within your editor
- Free and open source
- Less polished visually than web-based alternatives
- Requires more setup (kernel installation, configuration)
- Great for existing Atom/Pulsar users
- Best for private/local development
- Limited visualization capabilities out of the box

RunKit:
- Web-based, no local setup needed
- Instant access to any npm package
- Good for sharing code examples
- Free tier is generous
- Environment is isolated/sandboxed
- Built-in API endpoint generation
- Great for prototyping and sharing
- Limited compared to Observable for data visualization
- Less suitable for production development
- Each notebook runs in its own container

Observable:
- Most powerful visualization capabilities
- Reactive programming model (cells automatically update)
- Strong focus on data science and visualization
- Active community with many examples
- Steeper learning curve
- Uses its own flavor of JavaScript (Observable JS)
- Best for:
  - Data visualization projects
  - Interactive demonstrations
  - Public-facing notebooks
  - Collaborative data analysis
- More opinionated about how you structure your code
- Has both free and paid tiers

Quick recommendation guide:
- Choose Hydrogen if: You want to stay in Atom/Pulsar and work with local files/projects
- Choose RunKit if: You want quick prototyping and code sharing without setup
- Choose Observable if: You're doing data visualization or need reactive notebooks

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show some specific examples of how they handle common tasks differently?
