 The Interactive Window feature that supports Node.js notebooks is specifically tied to VS Code and its architecture. It's not directly portable to Atom/Pulsar because it relies on VS Code's extension API and the built-in Jupyter support that Microsoft has developed specifically for VS Code.

For Atom/Pulsar, you have a few alternatives:

1. Hydrogen 
   - This is probably your best bet for Atom/Pulsar
   - It's a package that provides notebook-like functionality
   - Supports multiple kernels including JavaScript/Node.js
   - Install the `ijavascript` kernel first:

```bash
npm install -g ijavascript
ijsinstall
```

2. Use platform-independent options:
   - RunKit (web-based)
   - Observable (web-based)
   - JupyterLab (browser-based but runs locally)

The key difference is that VS Code's implementation is deeply integrated with their language services and extension ecosystem, while Atom/Pulsar would need to rely on more generic implementations through packages like Hydrogen.

Would you like me to explain how to set up Hydrogen for Atom/Pulsar specifically? It's a bit different from VS Code's implementation but can achieve similar functionality.
