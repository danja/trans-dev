# [Node.js Notebook Equivalents](https://claude.ai/chat/2ea976a8-ac6f-4bce-8dbd-6a58a9787da0)

 Got it - that narrows things down significantly. Let's focus on the fully open source options:

Hydrogen:
- Fully open source (MIT License)
- All components are open source:
  - The Hydrogen package itself
  - The IJavaScript kernel (BSD-3-Clause)
  - The underlying Jupyter protocol
- No paid features or limitations
- Can work completely offline
- Community-driven development
- Can integrate with any Jupyter kernel

Alternative FOSS options I didn't mention before:
1. Jupyterlab with Node.js kernel
   - 100% open source (BSD license)
   - More setup required but very powerful
   - Better suited if you work with multiple languages
   - Full web IDE experience
   
2. Visual Studio Codium + Jupyter extension
   - Open source build of VS Code without Microsoft's proprietary bits
   - Similar notebook experience to VS Code
   - All open source components

RunKit and Observable both have significant proprietary components, so we should drop those from consideration.

Would you like me to proceed with explaining Hydrogen setup and usage? It sounds like it might be the best fit given:
1. You're already using Atom/Pulsar
2. You want fully open source
3. You want Node.js notebook functionality
4. You want to work locally

The setup isn't too complex but does require installing a few components to get everything working together.
